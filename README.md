PowerShell scripts for SharePoint

In this Project, we want to share some PowerShell scripts intended to help SharePoint Administrators and Developers to work and do some common tasks when working with SharePoint 2013. 

The scripts are grouped in the following sections:

- Audit. These scripts are intended to extract information from a SharePoint environment. The idea is to simplify the process of documenting and auditing a SharePoint farm.
- Deployment. These scripts are intended to help on deployment solutions and features. 
- Utils. These are intended to help with some administration functionalities.

This project is powered by CompartiMOSS (www.compartimoss.com), a free Spanish SharePoint Magazine.
