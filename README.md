PowerShell scripts for SharePoint

In this Project, we want to share some PowerShell scripts that help SharePoint Administrators and Developers work with the server. 

Scripts are grouped in the following sections:

- Audit. These are to extract information from SharePoint and audit systems.  
- Deployment. These are to help on deployment solutions and features. 
- Utils. These are to help with some admins functionalities.

This project is powered by CompartiMOSS, a free Spanish SharePoint Magazine.
